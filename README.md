# Complexity-Management

Management of complexity is crucial for successfull development of products and business processes. To avoid superfluous complexity in products and processes the innovation process needs to include an analysis and synthesis of complexity and the impact of complexity. Furthermore the impact of complexity must be quantified in terms of impact on costs, delivery performance, flow in production, quality etc. The course objective is to give students competencies and operational skills to analyse and quantify complexity costs in a company. Furthermore, the course aims at achieving an understanding of the basic principles of complexity management, and how to apply these principles when making strategy for products and processes. Learning takes place through project work, where operational skills within analysis and quantification of complexity costs are learned
