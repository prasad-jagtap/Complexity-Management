# Complexity-Management

Management of complexity is crucial for the successful development of products and business processes. To avoid superfluous complexity in products and processes the innovation process needs to include an analysis and synthesis of complexity and the impact of complexity. Furthermore, the impact of complexity was quantified in terms of impact on costs, delivery performance, flow in production, quality, etc. The project included competencies and operational skills to analyze and quantify complexity costs in a company - garden A/S. Furthermore, the project achieved an understanding of the basic principles of complexity management, and techniques to apply the principles when making strategy for products and processes.
